********CONSTURCTORS IN DERIVED CLASSES*******

1) we can use constructors in derived classes in C++.

2) if base class constructors does not have any arguments, there is no need
of any constructor in derived class.

3)But if there are one or more arguments in the base class constructor,
derived class need to pass arguments to the base class constructor.

4) If both base and derived classes have constructors, base class constructor
is executed first.

*********CONSTURCTORS IN MULTIPLE INHERITENCE*********

1) In multiple inheritence, base classes are constructed in the order in which 
they appear in the class declaration.

2) In multilevel inheritence, the constructors are executed in the order of inheritence.

****** SPECIAL CASE OF VIRTUAL BASE CLASS *******
1) The constructors for virtual base classes are invoked before an 
nonvirtual base class.
2) If there are multiple virtual base classes, they are invoked in 
the order declared.
3) Any non-virtual base class are then constructed before the derived
class constructor is executed.

/* ORDER OF EXECUTION OF CONSTURCTORS
case 1: 
class B: public A {
    //order of execution of constructor - first A() then B()
};

case 2:
class A: public B,public C{
    //order of execution of constructor -> B() then C() and A()
}

case 3:
class A:public B,virtual public C{
// Order of execution of constructor -> 
C() then B() and A()
};
