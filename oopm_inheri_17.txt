       ******* Inheritence in C++ *******

* Reusability is a very important feature if OOPs.
* In C++ we reuse a class and add additional features to it.
* Reusing classes saves time and money
* Reusing already tested and debugged class will save a lot of effort of 
* developing and debugging the same thing again.

What is Inheritence in C++ ?
Ans:- * The concept of Reusability in C++ is supported using Inheritence.
      * We can reuse the properties of an existing class by inheriting from it.
      * The existing class is called as the Base class.
      * The new class which is inherited is called as the derived class.
      * Reusing classes saves time and money.

Forms of Inheritence:--
* Single Inheritence. --> A derived class with only one Base class.
* Multiple Inheritence. --> A derived class with more than one Base class.
* Hierarchical Inheritence. --> Several derived classes from a single base class.
* Multilevel Inheritence. --> Deriving a class from already derived class.
* Hybrid Inheritence --> :: Hybrid Inheritence is a combination of multiple 
                            and multilevel Inheritence. 
                         :: A class is derived from two classes as in multiple Inheritence.
                         :: However, one of the parent classes is not a base class.
