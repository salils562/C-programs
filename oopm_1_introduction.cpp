// Object oriented programming in C++
/* OOP works on the concept of classes and objects.
A class is a template to create objects.
Treats data as a critical element. */
// C++ language was designed with the main intension of adding object oriented features
/* As the size of the program increses redability, maintainability and bug-free nature of programs 
decreases.
In OOPM classes solves problem of security to code. The old name of C++ was C with classes */

/* BASIC CONCEPTS IN OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING 
1) Classes - basic template for creating objects.
2) Objects - basic run time entities.
3) Data abstraction and encapsulation - wrapping data and funtions into single unit.
4) inheritence - properties of one class can be inherited into others.
5) polymosphism - ability to take more than one forms.
6) Dynamic Binding - code which will execute is not known until the program runs.
7) Message passing - Object.message call format. */

/* Benefits of object oriented programming :- 
better code reusability using objects and inheritence.
principle of data hiding helps build secure systems.
multiple objects can co-exist without any interference.
software complexity can be easily managed. */
