*****Introduction to STL*****
STL stands for standard template library.
(library of generic class and functions)

Why use STL?
ans= we are reusing well tested components.

components of STL:-
*Containers- Stores data (use template classes)
*Algorithms 
*Iterators - Object points to an element in a Containers.
STL is used because its a good
idea not to re-invent the wheel.

There are 3 types of Containers in STL:-
1) Sequence Containers.--> Stores data in Linear fashion 
2) Associative Containers. --> Direct access (example- set, multi-set)
3) Derived Containers. --> Real world modeling. (example - stack,queue,priority-queue)

When to use which?
Sequence Containers --> random access is fast whereas, insertion and deletion is slow.
Associative Containers --> All operations are fast execpt random access.
Derived Containers --> Depends --> data structure.
